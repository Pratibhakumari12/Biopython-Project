Bioinformatics project identifying an unknown protein sequence using Biopython and BLAST
# BioPython Project: In-Silico Sequence Identification

*Student Name:* Pratibha Kumari
*Tools:* VS Code, Python, Biopython (NCBIWWW)

## Description
This project automates the identification of an unknown biological sequence using Python. It connects programmatically to the NCBI BLAST server (without using a browser) to identify the gene.

## Results
The script identified the sequence as *Insulin Isoform UB [Homo sapiens]* with an E-value of 1.06e-73.
